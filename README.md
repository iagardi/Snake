# Snake
A classic Snake game built with HTML, CSS-SCSS and JavaScript during week 5 and week 6 of the _nology course. This was an open, "build a game in JavaScript" challenge and I chose this game because I really enjoyed playing it on my Nokia in the early 2000s. 

# Technologies used
HTML5, SCSS and JavaScript ES6. 

# How it works
The game was build on a grid base and starts by pressing any of the arrow keys. The head of the snake then starts to move to the direction of the arrow (jumping 1 grid every 500ms) and changes direction when pressing any other arrow key. Once the head reaches a "bug" it grows in length and continues to move. 
 - Game speed increases every 15 seconds by 100ms
 - Game over is triggered when the "snake" hits the wall or itself (this also applies when changing direction into itself). 



# Future development plans
 - Currently the only way to start a new game is by refreshing the page, a restart button is in progress.
